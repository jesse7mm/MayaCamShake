# MayaCamShake
Python script to add camera shake to an animated camera move

Change "camera1" on line 27 to the name of the renderable camera in your scene if you are not using the default camera

You need to have at least two keyframes to add shake or you will get a warning.  You may also adjust the amount and frequence of the shakes.

To use this script:

Open Maya
Open the Script Editor
Paste this script into a Python tab
Execute the script
You may also middle-mouse drag the code to the shelf to create a custom button in Maya
